Documentation Repository - Developer Guide
==============================================

The document is intended to help developers build applications with the **Documentation Repository API**. It is meant to be used alongside the automatically generated Swagger documentation which contains a list of the endpoints and the relevant data models.

The Document Repository API is RESTful API built using ASP.NET Core 2.0. It is used for publishing and displaying technical documentation. It produces and consumes data in the JSON format. The full source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/mihailo-stevanovic/documentation-repository>`_.

.. note:: The **Documentation Repository** is a test project that was never intended to be used in production.
   The documentation is presented as a sample of the author's technical writing skills.
