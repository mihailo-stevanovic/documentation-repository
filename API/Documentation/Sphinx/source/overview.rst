Overview
========

The API was designed three basic applications:

1. **Internal Documentation Portal** - used for displaying published documents to internal users (i.e. company employees).

2. **Client Documentation Portal** - used for displaying limited information regarding published documents to external users (i.e. company's clients) with specific user rights (*Client Catalogs*).

    .. note:: This has not been fully implemented yet.

3. **Administrative App** - used for publishing documents and administrating the main entities. The admin app is intended to be used by the company's Documentation team.


The API enables you to work with the following entities:

* :doc:`internal_docs/main`
* :doc:`authors` 
* Client Catalogs
* Documents
* Document Updates
* Document Types
* Products
* Product Versions
