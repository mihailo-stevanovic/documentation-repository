# Internal Documentation Portal

## About

The portal app was built using React.js with TypeScript and Material UI. It relies on the API to retrieve the relevant information from the database. It only uses GET endpoints because the information is read-only.

## Documentation

Dedicated documentation for the portal (namely a User Guide) is currently being written.
